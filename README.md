# Project: Digit Classification Using CNNs and Transformers with Website Development 

This project aims to achieve over 99% accuracy on the MNIST dataset by building and comparing two types of neural networks: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Vision Transformer. The goal is to optimize the architectures of these networks and assess their performance on the MNIST test set.

## Key Features:
**Network Structures:** Experimented with various CNN and Transformer architectures, tuning parameters such as layer types, filter sizes, batch sizes, and number of epochs to maximize accuracy.

**Evaluation:** The best-performing networks were trained on the full dataset and evaluated on the test set, with a focus on identifying common misclassifications and understanding their causes.

**Interactive Webpage:** Developed an Anvil-based web app that allows users to upload a 28x28 CSV file representing an MNIST digit, which the app then classifies using both the CNN and Transformer models. The app includes user authentication, image visualization, and classification feedback.

**Cloud Integration:** Leveraged AWS Lightsail for running backend Python code, enabling the Anvil app to utilize TensorFlow and other necessary libraries.

This project not only demonstrates the power of neural networks in image classification but also highlights the importance of making machine learning accessible through interactive web applications.
